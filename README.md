# Zyebot-Dota2-Arcana-Store
This is an application that simulates the process of buying Arcana (similar to any other items within Steam) from third-party websites such as OPSkins or Bitskins where these services offer you a virtual inventory within their service. They allow you to withdraw from your inventory to your Steam account's inventory. Coded in Scala as the back-end & ScalaFX as the front-end.
